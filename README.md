# NeoGym

A modern fitness app scaffold built on **TanStack Start** + **Nhost** with **Tailwind v4** and **shadcn/ui**.

The frontend is a fully type-safe React 19 SSR app driven by file-based routing. The backend runs on Nhost Cloud (Hasura + Auth + Postgres + Storage + Functions); the Nhost CLI brings up a local Docker mirror of the same stack for development. Tooling — `bun`, `biome`, XcodeGen, Python/Pillow/python-dotenv, Ruby, and Fastlane — is provisioned through a Nix flake so contributors get a reproducible dev environment.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Framework | TanStack Start (React 19, Vite 8, Nitro) |
| Routing | TanStack Router (file-based) |
| Data | TanStack Query + `@nhost/nhost-js` v4 (`nhost.graphql.request`) |
| Auth | Nhost Auth (email OTP for sign-in/sign-up; PKCE email-link verification for change-email) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first `@theme`) + shadcn/ui |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod |
| Lint/Format | Biome |
| Runtime / pkg manager | Bun |
| Codegen | graphql-codegen `client-preset` |
| Backend | Nhost (Hasura, Auth, Storage, Postgres, MailHog) |
| iOS | SwiftUI app generated with XcodeGen + local `NeoGymKit` SwiftPM package |

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (the Nhost CLI runs the local stack via Docker)
- [Nhost CLI](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/cli) — install via `brew install nhost/cli/nhost` or the upstream installer
- Xcode for iOS simulator builds
- Local Nhost Swift SDK checkout at `/Users/dbarroso/workspace/nhost/nhost/swift/packages/nhost-swift` for the native app

`bun`, `biome`, Darwin-available XcodeGen, Python/Pillow/python-dotenv, Ruby, and Fastlane come from the Nix devshell — no host install needed for those tools. The repository overlay packages Fastlane 2.237.0 from a hashed gem closure under `nix/fastlane/`. If the pinned Nixpkgs ever lacks XcodeGen on Darwin, install `xcodegen` with Homebrew and keep the tracked iOS xcconfigs/plists/entitlements plus `project.yml` authoritative.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Boot the backend
cd backend
nhost up

# 2. Boot the frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
nix develop ../ --command bun install   # first run only — also compiles biome (~15–25 min on first machine setup)
nix develop ../ --command bun run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

A fresh checkout has no ignored `backend/.secrets`. If `nhost up` reports
`no secrets found`, do not run `nhost init` over the tracked `backend/nhost/`
directory (the CLI refuses an existing Nhost folder). From the repository root,
generate local-only secrets in a scratch project and copy only that ignored
file:

```sh
scratch="$(mktemp -d)"
(cd "$scratch" && nhost init)
install -m 600 "$scratch/.secrets" backend/.secrets
rm -rf "$scratch"
```

Try the flow:

1. Visit `http://localhost:5173`, click **Get started**
2. Fill in display name + email — you'll see "Check your inbox"
3. Open MailHog, copy the 6-digit code, paste it into the OTP field → you land on `/profile`
4. From `/profile`, request an email change — open MailHog, click the verification link → you land on `/verify` → the new email is confirmed and you're redirected back to `/profile`
5. Sign out from the navbar, sign back in via `/signin` (email → 6-digit code)

## Available commands

All run from `frontend/` and require `nix develop ../ --command` as a prefix unless you've already entered the devshell with `nix develop ..`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun install` | Install / sync dependencies |
| `bun run dev` | Start the dev server on `:5173` (HMR + SSR) |
| `bun run build` | Production build (Vite + Nitro) |
| `bun run start` | Run the built server (`.output/server/index.mjs`) |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `bun run lint` | `biome check .` (lint + format check) |
| `bun run format` | `biome format --write .` |
| `bun run codegen` | Generate typed GraphQL operations into `src/gql/` (requires backend up) |

Backend (from `backend/`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nhost up` | Start the local stack |
| `nhost down` | Stop the local stack |
| `nhost config validate` | Validate `nhost.toml` after editing |
| `nhost logs <service>` | Tail a service's logs |

Native iOS (from `ios/NeoGym/`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `swift build` | Build the host-compatible `NeoGymKit` package |
| `swift test` | Run deterministic `NeoGymKit` unit tests |
| `nix develop ../.. --command Scripts/check.sh` | Run the credential-free canonical iOS gate and both generic simulator builds |
| `nix develop ../.. --command Scripts/generate-project.sh all` | Materialize both ignored variant configs and generate both schemes |
| `python3 Scripts/verify-artifact.py --variant development|production <path>` | Validate an app/archive/IPA and its embedded widget against selected configuration |
| `nix develop ../.. --command fastlane check --env production` | Run overlay-pinned Ruby release tests plus the canonical iOS gate |
| `nix develop ../.. --command fastlane beta --env production` | Credential-gated archive, exact artifact validation, race check, and TestFlight upload |
| `xcodebuild -project NeoGym.xcodeproj -scheme 'NeoGym Dev' -configuration Debug-Development -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` | Build the co-installable development app |
| `xcodebuild -project NeoGym.xcodeproj -scheme NeoGym -configuration Debug-Production -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` | Build the production-identity app |

The native app supports the same local email OTP sign-in/sign-up shape as the
web app: request a 6-digit code, copy it from MailHog, verify, view the
protected profile, and sign out. Sign-out always clears the local SDK session
store after the remote request attempt. Production resolves
`neogym://verify`; development resolves `neogym-dev://verify`. Both callbacks
are present in the local Nhost allowlist and the production overlay. Restart
local Nhost after any redirect-config edit because the CLI does not hot-reload
`nhost.toml`.

## Configuration

The frontend reads three env vars. Local dev values live in `frontend/.env`:

```sh
# frontend/.env
VITE_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=local
VITE_NHOST_REGION=local
VITE_MCP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Production build values live in `frontend/.env.production` (committed) and are picked up automatically by `bun run build`. Override any of them on the command line for ad-hoc builds: `VITE_MCP_URL=https://… bun run build`.

`VITE_NHOST_*` point at the Nhost backend; `VITE_MCP_URL` is the MCP endpoint surfaced on the home page so users can connect their agent.

Auth redirect config is split between local-dev defaults in `backend/nhost/nhost.toml` and production overrides in the project overlay at `backend/nhost/overlays/<project-id>.json`:

```toml
# backend/nhost/nhost.toml — local-dev baseline
[auth.redirections]
clientUrl = 'http://localhost:5173'
allowedUrls = ['neogym://verify', 'neogym-dev://verify']
```

```json
// backend/nhost/overlays/<project-id>.json — production (JSON Patch)
{ "op": "replace", "path": "/auth/redirections/clientUrl",
  "value": "https://neogym.nhost.app" }
{ "op": "add",     "path": "/auth/redirections/allowedUrls",
  "value": ["neogym://verify", "neogym-dev://verify"] }
```

Any subpath of `clientUrl` is accepted as a `redirectTo` target by default — that's how the web email-change flow lands back on `/verify` without any extra configuration. Redirects outside that origin, including both native callbacks, must be listed in `auth.redirections.allowedUrls` in both files. Keep the dev port in `clientUrl` aligned with `frontend/vite.config.ts` and restart the local Nhost stack after redirect-config edits.

The checked-in production overlay is deployment input, not proof of effective
cloud state. After an operator deploys that exact overlay through the supported
Nhost process and verifies both callbacks against project
`spmqtxqkdoxvtrkrfnnl`, copy
`ios/NeoGym/fastlane/cloud-callback-receipt.production.example.json` to the
ignored `cloud-callback-receipt.production.json`, then record the UTC
verification time and verifier identity. Recompute the lowercase SHA-256 from
the exact overlay bytes if necessary:

```sh
shasum -a 256 backend/nhost/overlays/spmqtxqkdoxvtrkrfnnl.json
python3 ios/NeoGym/Scripts/verify-cloud-callback-receipt.py
```

The receipt is an operator attestation, not authenticated cloud inspection.
Never create it without effective verification. Its absence or a hash mismatch
blocks the production archive/TestFlight lanes before Xcode archive and is
checked again before upload. See `ios/NeoGym/README.md` for the overlay-pinned
Fastlane setup, Apple portal/signing/API-key prerequisites, unique build-number behavior,
and clean-checkout release rehearsal. Fastlane does not create portal resources
or replace local Xcode distribution signing.

## What's not in v1 (yet)

- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Password reset / change-password (no passwords — auth is OTP only)
- Profile display-name and avatar editing
- SSR-aware auth via Nhost cookie storage
- CI / deploy preset (will add when the hosting target is known)
